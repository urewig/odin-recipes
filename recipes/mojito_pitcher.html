    <h2>Make a jug of refreshing mojitos to share, so you can spend more time with your guests.</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 limes, plus 1 lime sliced, to serve</li>
        <li>4 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4-5 mint sprigs</li>
        <li>ice</li>
        <li>350ml white rum</li>
        <li>600ml sparking water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Chop each lime into six pieces and drop them into a two-litre jug. 
            Add the sugar and squish the lime wedges with a muddler, or the end of a rolling pin. 
            Keep crushing to get out all the juices.
        </li>

        <li>
            Pick the leaves off a mint spring and lay them on one of your hands. 
            Clap the other hand on top to bruise the leaves ever so gently, then drop them into the jug. 
            Repeat with the rest of the mint spring.
        </li>

        <li>
            Fill up the jug about three-quarters full with ice, then add the rum. 
            Stir with a long-handled spoon to mix all the ingredients together gently and top up with the sparkling water. 
            Stir once more, then serve poured into tall glasses with a few extra ice cubes and lime slices.
        </li>
    </ol>
